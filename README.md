# indexracer
Calculator website for SCCA racers

Calculates indexed time for cars from each category and class and compares the user to another racer. The user can see who won, or if only one person has run, what time the other will need to win. As a supplement, a table is generated from the user's information to show the comparative time of all other classes.
